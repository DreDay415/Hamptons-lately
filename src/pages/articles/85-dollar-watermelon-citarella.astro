						<em>Peloton Riders on Road - Former indoor cyclists take to the streets, causing unprecedented traffic jams as they discover the concept of outdoor cycling and sharing space with motorists.</em>

				<div class="article-content">
					<p><strong>EAST HAMPTON, NY</strong> ‚Äî In what local officials are calling "the most unexpected traffic crisis of the summer," Hamptons roads have become nearly impassable after a group of Peloton enthusiasts discovered that cycling can be done outdoors.</p>

					<p>"It's like they've never seen the sun before," said East Hampton traffic coordinator Jennifer Martinez. "We're seeing people in full Peloton gear riding bikes on actual roads, and they seem completely bewildered by the concept of sharing space with cars."</p>

					<h2>üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The Great Peloton Migration</h2>
					<p>The crisis began last week when several local Peloton owners decided to "take their workout outside." "I was getting bored of riding in my living room," said former indoor cyclist Tom O'Brien. "I thought, 'Why not ride on the actual road? It can't be that different from my Peloton.'"</p>

					<p>O'Brien and his fellow cyclists quickly discovered that outdoor cycling involves several challenges they hadn't considered:
					- Traffic lights that don't pause for them
					- Cars that don't automatically give them space
					- Weather conditions that affect their ride
					- Roads that aren't perfectly smooth like their Peloton</p>

					<h2>üöó The Traffic Impact</h2>
					<p>The influx of outdoor cyclists has created unprecedented traffic problems. "We're seeing 20-minute delays on roads that normally take 5 minutes to drive," said Martinez. "The cyclists are riding in groups of 10-15 people, taking up entire lanes, and they seem to think they have the right of way everywhere."</p>

					<p>Local motorists are frustrated. "I was late to my tennis lesson because of these people," said East Hampton resident Amanda Rodriguez. "I mean, I get that they want to exercise, but do they have to do it on the main road during rush hour? Can't they go back to their living rooms?"</p>

					<h2>üéØ The Learning Curve</h2>
					<p>Many of the outdoor cyclists are struggling with basic road etiquette. "They're stopping at green lights because they're used to their Peloton instructor telling them when to go," said local cycling instructor David Park. "They're also riding in the middle of the road because they're used to having the entire living room to themselves."</p>

					<p>Other issues include:
					- Cyclists who don't know how to use hand signals
					- Groups that ride three abreast across entire lanes
					- Riders who stop suddenly to take Instagram photos
					- Cyclists who expect cars to wait for them at every intersection</p>

					<h2>üí∞ The Economic Fallout</h2>
					<p>The traffic crisis is affecting local businesses. "We're losing customers because people can't get here," said restaurant owner Pierre Dubois. "I had a reservation for 12 people cancel because they were stuck behind a group of cyclists for 45 minutes. They just turned around and went home."</p>

					<p>Local delivery services are also suffering. "We can't make our delivery times anymore," said delivery driver Mike Thompson. "I'm supposed to deliver food in 30 minutes, but it's taking me an hour just to get through the traffic. People are getting cold food and blaming us."</p>

					<h2>üèÜ The Response</h2>
					<p>Local officials are considering several solutions. "We're thinking of creating dedicated cycling lanes," said Mayor Sarah Johnson. "But honestly, I'd rather just encourage these people to go back to their Pelotons. The roads were fine before they discovered the outdoors."</p>

					<p>Some residents have taken matters into their own hands. "I've started honking my horn at cyclists who are blocking traffic," said Rodriguez. "I know it's not polite, but neither is making me late for my tennis lesson. I paid $200 for that lesson, and I'm not going to miss it because someone wants to ride their bike outdoors."</p>

					<h2>üåÖ What's Next?</h2>
					<p>The cyclists show no signs of returning to their indoor workouts. "I'm never going back to my Peloton," said O'Brien. "The outdoors is amazing. The fresh air, the scenery, the sense of freedom - it's like nothing I've ever experienced before."</p>

					<p>Local officials are considering more drastic measures:
					- Requiring cyclists to obtain outdoor cycling licenses
					- Implementing cycling curfews during peak traffic hours
					- Creating designated cycling routes away from main roads
					- Offering incentives for cyclists to return to indoor workouts</p>
