				<div class="article-content">
					<p><strong>EAST HAMPTON, NY</strong> ‚Äî In what local preservationists are calling "a victory for American history," a backyard tennis court has been officially rezoned as a National Historic Landmark, making it the first private sports facility to receive such recognition.</p>

					<p>The court, located behind the home of local resident Jennifer Martinez, was declared historically significant after historians discovered it was "the first place where someone paid $500 for a tennis lesson."</p>

					<h2>üèõÔ∏è The Historical Significance</h2>
					<p>"This tennis court represents a pivotal moment in American luxury culture," said Dr. Sarah Chen, professor of Hamptons History at East Hampton University. "It's where the concept of paying exorbitant amounts for basic activities was first normalized. Before this court, people thought $50 for a tennis lesson was expensive. Now we know better."</p>

					<p>The court's historical value was further enhanced by its unique features, including:
					- The first tennis court with a built-in champagne cooler
					- The first court where players could order sushi between sets
					- The first court with a dedicated Instagram photo area
					- The first court where spectators paid $100 to watch</p>

					<h2>üéæ The Court's Story</h2>
					<p>Built in 2018, the court was originally intended as a simple backyard addition. "I just wanted somewhere to play tennis," said Martinez. "But then my tennis pro suggested we add some 'luxury touches,' and things got out of hand."</p>

					<p>Those luxury touches included:
					- Imported Italian clay from a quarry that only produces clay for luxury tennis courts
					- Hand-painted lines by a former museum curator
					- A sound system that plays classical music during matches
					- A temperature-controlled ball storage system
					- A "championship atmosphere" that costs extra</p>

					<h2>üìú The Rezoning Process</h2>
					<p>The landmark designation came after a six-month review process that involved historians, architects, and luxury lifestyle experts. "We had to determine if this court truly represented a turning point in American culture," said preservation officer Tom O'Brien. "After reviewing the evidence, we concluded that yes, it absolutely does."</p>

					<p>The court now joins other historic sites like the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore, and the first Starbucks in Seattle. "It's an honor," said Martinez. "I never thought my tennis court would be mentioned in the same breath as the Liberty Bell."</p>

					<h2>üí∞ The Economic Impact</h2>
					<p>Since receiving landmark status, the court has become a major tourist attraction. "People come from all over to see where luxury tennis was invented," said local tour guide Amanda Rodriguez. "We charge $75 for a guided tour, which includes a photo opportunity and a certificate of authenticity."</p>

					<p>The landmark status has also increased property values in the area. "Homes near the tennis court are now worth 15% more," said real estate agent David Park. "People want to live near history, especially expensive history."</p>

					<h2>üé≠ Local Reactions</h2>
					<p>The landmark designation has sparked mixed reactions among local residents. "I think it's ridiculous," said East Hampton resident Mike Thompson. "It's just a tennis court. My neighbor has one too, and it's not a national landmark."</p>

					<p>"Actually, your neighbor's court might qualify too," said Dr. Chen. "We're reviewing several other courts for potential landmark status. The criteria include having paid more than $400 for a tennis lesson or having a court that costs more than the average American home."</p>

					<h2>üèÜ What's Next?</h2>
					<p>The landmark designation has inspired other luxury amenities to seek similar recognition. "We're considering applications for the first $200 smoothie bar, the first $1,000 beach umbrella, and the first $5,000 parking spot," said O'Brien. "These are all important pieces of American luxury history."</p>

					<p>As for Martinez, she's now offering "historic tennis lessons" on her landmark court. "It's $750 for a lesson now," she said. "But that includes a tour of the historic features and a certificate saying you played on a national landmark. It's worth every penny."</p>
