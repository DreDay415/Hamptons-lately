					<p><strong>SAG HARBOR, NY</strong> ‚Äî In what has become the Hamptons' most heated debate since "Is it pronounced 'Montauk' or 'Montauk'?", the question of which bar reigns supreme in Sag Harbor continues to divide locals, weekend warriors, and tourists alike.</p>

					<p>The battle lines are drawn between two iconic establishments: Murf's Tavern, the self-proclaimed "oldest bar in Sag Harbor," and Corner Bar, which claims to be "the most authentic local experience." Spoiler alert: neither is actually frequented by real locals.</p>

					<h2>üç∫ Murf's Tavern: The "Historic" Option</h2>
					<p>Murf's Tavern, established in 1962 (which in Hamptons years is basically prehistoric), has built its reputation on being "the place where Hemingway would have drunk if he had summered in the Hamptons instead of Key West."</p>

					<p>"We're not just a bar, we're a cultural institution," said Murf's manager Jennifer Martinez. "We have the same stools that were here when the bar opened, and the same prices adjusted for inflation, which means a $25 Bud Light."</p>

					<p>Murf's signature features include:
					- Wooden walls that haven't been cleaned since the Nixon administration
					- A jukebox that only plays songs from the 1970s (because that's when it was installed)
					- Bartenders who remember "when this place was really local"
					- A clientele that's 90% tourists pretending to be locals</p>

					<h2>üç∏ Corner Bar: The "Authentic" Experience</h2>
					<p>Corner Bar, located at the corner of Main Street and the intersection of "We're Local" and "We're Expensive," markets itself as the genuine Sag Harbor experience. "We're where the real locals come," said owner Tom O'Brien. "By 'real locals,' I mean people who have been coming here for at least three summers."</p>

					<p>Corner Bar's unique selling points include:
					- A "locals' discount" that makes a $20 cocktail only $18
					- A menu that changes daily based on what the chef "feels like making"
					- A strict "no photos" policy (because nothing says authentic like preventing Instagram posts)
					- A clientele that's 95% weekend visitors who think they're locals</p>

					<h2>üèÜ The Great Debate</h2>
					<p>The rivalry between these establishments has reached such intensity that local residents have formed factions. "I'm Team Murf's all the way," said East Hampton resident Sarah Kim. "I've been going there since I was 21, which was last summer, but still."</p>

					<p>"Corner Bar is clearly superior," countered Manhattan weekend visitor Amanda Rodriguez. "I've been coming here every summer since I was 5, so I'm basically a local, and I can tell you that Corner Bar has the best $25 gin and tonic in the Hamptons."</p>

					<h2>üí∞ The Price Comparison</h2>
					<p>Both establishments have mastered the art of charging premium prices for standard drinks. Here's the breakdown:</p>

					<p><strong>Murf's Tavern:</strong><br>
					- Bud Light: $25 ("Historic pricing")<br>
					- House wine: $35 ("Premium selection")<br>
					- Well cocktail: $28 ("Craft spirits")<br>
					- Local authenticity: $15 (added to every bill)</p>

					<p><strong>Corner Bar:</strong><br>
					- Local craft beer: $22 ("Supporting local breweries")<br>
					- Signature cocktail: $32 ("Chef's special")<br>
					- Wine by the glass: $38 ("Curated selection")<br>
					- Local experience fee: $12 (mandatory surcharge)</p>

					<h2>üé≠ The "Local" Experience</h2>
					<p>Both bars claim to offer the authentic Sag Harbor experience, but what that actually means is open to interpretation. "Being a local means knowing the bartender's name," said Murf's regular Mike Thompson. "I've been coming here for two summers, and the bartender finally remembered my drink order last week."</p>

					<p>"Local means being part of the community," said Corner Bar enthusiast David Park. "I've been coming here for three summers, and I can tell you exactly which table the celebrities sit at when they want to be seen being local."</p>

					<h2>üèÜ The Verdict</h2>
					<p>After extensive research (which involved visiting both bars and spending approximately $200 on drinks), our conclusion is clear: both establishments are equally overpriced and equally inauthentic, but that's exactly what makes them perfect for the Hamptons.</p>

					<p>"The beauty of this debate is that there's no wrong answer," said local sociologist Dr. Pierre Dubois. "Both bars serve the same purpose: allowing visitors to feel like they're experiencing authentic local culture while paying premium prices for standard drinks. It's the Hamptons way."</p>

					<h2>What's Next?</h2>
					<p>The debate shows no signs of cooling down. Both bars are planning expansions, with Murf's adding a "Historic Beer Garden" (prices start at $30 for a beer) and Corner Bar introducing a "Local's Only" section (minimum spend $100 to enter).</p>

					<p>As for the real locals? They're still drinking at home, where a six-pack costs $12 instead of $150, and where they don't have to pretend to be someone they're not.</p>
