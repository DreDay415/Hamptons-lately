					<p><strong>EAST HAMPTON, NY</strong> ‚Äî In what local legal experts are calling "the most Hamptons lawsuit ever," a local homeowner has filed suit against his pool contractor after discovering that his $2 million "infinity pool" has a visible edge, making it technically finite.</p>

					<p>"I paid for infinity, and I expect infinity," said plaintiff Michael Rodriguez, 47, a Manhattan hedge fund manager who summers in the Hamptons. "When I look at my pool, I want to feel like I'm swimming into the horizon, not like I'm swimming toward a wall."</p>

					<h2>üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Pool That Wasn't Infinite</h2>
					<p>The dispute centers around Rodriguez's custom infinity pool, which was completed last summer at a cost of $2.1 million. The pool features a vanishing edge that appears to blend seamlessly with the landscape, creating the illusion of swimming into the horizon.</p>

					<p>"The problem is that when you get close to the edge, you can see where the pool ends," explained Rodriguez's attorney, Jennifer Park. "My client was promised a truly infinite experience, and what he got was a very expensive pool with a visible boundary. That's false advertising."</p>

					<h2>üîç The Technical Details</h2>
					<p>According to the lawsuit, the contractor, East Hampton Pools & Spas, marketed the pool as having "true infinity edge technology" that would create "the illusion of swimming into the horizon." However, Rodriguez claims that when he swims to the edge, he can clearly see where the water ends.</p>

					<p>"I can see the concrete lip," Rodriguez said. "I can see the drainage system. I can see that this is just a regular pool with a fancy edge. That's not what I paid for."</p>

					<p>The contractor's response? "All infinity pools have edges," said company owner Tom O'Brien. "That's how infinity pools work. The water flows over the edge, creating the illusion of infinity. If you want a truly infinite pool, you'd need to buy the ocean."</p>

					<h2>üí∞ The Price Breakdown</h2>
					<p>The $2.1 million pool includes several luxury features that Rodriguez says don't work as advertised:</p>

					<p>- **Infinity edge**: $800,000 (currently visible)<br>
					- **Heated water**: $300,000 (water is warm, but not "luxuriously warm")<br>
					- **LED lighting system**: $250,000 (lights work, but don't create "mood")<br>
					- **Waterfall feature**: $400,000 (water falls, but not "dramatically")<br>
					- **Premium tile work**: $350,000 (tiles are nice, but not "museum quality")</p>

					<h2>‚öñÔ∏è The Legal Battle</h2>
					<p>The lawsuit alleges breach of contract, false advertising, and emotional distress. "My client has suffered significant emotional harm," said Park. "He can't enjoy his pool because every time he swims, he's reminded that he didn't get what he paid for."</p>

					<p>Rodriguez is seeking $5 million in damages, including the cost of the pool, emotional distress, and punitive damages. "I want them to either make the pool truly infinite or give me my money back," he said.</p>

					<h2>üèóÔ∏è The Contractor's Defense</h2>
					<p>East Hampton Pools & Spas maintains that they delivered exactly what was promised. "We built a beautiful infinity pool that meets all industry standards," said O'Brien. "The fact that it has edges is a feature, not a bug. That's how infinity pools work."</p>

					<p>The company has also pointed out that Rodriguez signed off on the design and approved the final product. "He was here during construction," O'Brien said. "He saw the plans. He knew what he was getting."</p>

					<h2>üé≠ Local Reactions</h2>
					<p>The lawsuit has become a topic of conversation throughout the Hamptons. "I think it's ridiculous," said East Hampton resident Sarah Kim. "If you want a truly infinite pool, you should buy a house on the ocean. That's the only way to get real infinity."</p>

					<p>"I love this lawsuit," said local real estate agent Amanda Rodriguez. "It's so perfectly Hamptons. Only here would someone sue over a pool not being infinite enough."</p>

					<h2>üî¨ Expert Testimony</h2>
					<p>The case has attracted attention from pool industry experts. "Technically, all infinity pools are finite," said Dr. David Chen, professor of aquatic architecture at East Hampton University. "The term 'infinity' refers to the visual effect, not the actual dimensions. It's like calling a car 'fast' - it's subjective."</p>

					<p>However, Chen also noted that Rodriguez's pool might not meet the highest standards for infinity edge technology. "A truly premium infinity pool should create the illusion of swimming into the horizon from multiple viewing angles," he said. "If you can see the edge from the water, that's a design flaw."</p>

					<h2>üèÜ The Settlement Offer</h2>
					<p>East Hampton Pools & Spas has offered to modify the pool to improve the infinity effect, but Rodriguez has rejected the offer. "I don't want them touching my pool again," he said. "I want them to either make it truly infinite or give me my money back so I can hire someone who knows what they're doing."</p>

					<p>The company's proposed modifications include:
					- Extending the vanishing edge by 6 inches ($50,000)
					- Adding additional drainage systems ($75,000)
		- Installing "infinity enhancement" lighting ($100,000)
		- Re-tiling the edge with "premium infinity tiles" ($125,000)</p>

					<h2>What's Next?</h2>
					<p>The case is scheduled to go to trial in September, and legal experts say it could set a precedent for luxury pool contracts in the Hamptons. "This could change how contractors market their services," said Park. "You can't just call something 'infinity' and expect people to accept whatever you give them."</p>

					<p>As for Rodriguez, he's already planning his next pool project. "I'm thinking about building a pool that actually connects to the ocean," he said. "That way, when I swim, I'm really swimming into infinity. It might cost $10 million, but at least I'll get what I pay for."</p>
