					<p><strong>HAMPTONS, NY</strong> ‚Äî Welcome to another edition of our Weekend Spotlight, where we break down the essential elements of a perfect Hamptons weekend: one thing to worry about, one thing to do, and one thing that will make you say "Only in the Hamptons."</p>

					<h2>üåä What to Worry About</h2>
					<p>This weekend, your primary concern should be whether your neighbor's new infinity pool is actually infinite, or just really expensive. "I've been staring at it for hours and I still can't see where it ends," said local resident Jennifer Martinez. "It's either a marvel of engineering or an optical illusion created by the $2 million price tag."</p>

					<p>Other legitimate worries include:
					- Whether the helicopter traffic will interfere with your Instagram sunset photos
					- If your beach umbrella costs more than your monthly car payment
					- Whether the person next to you at the farmers market is actually a celebrity
					- If your neighbor's landscaping budget exceeds your annual salary</p>

					<h2>üéØ What to Do</h2>
					<p>This weekend's must-do activity: pretend you've been coming here "forever" while asking directions to the nearest Starbucks. "It's a classic Hamptons move," explained weekend etiquette expert Tom O'Brien. "You want to project this air of casual familiarity while simultaneously being completely lost."</p>

					<p>Other recommended activities:
					- Attend a beach yoga class where everyone's mat costs more than your gym membership
					- Visit a local farm stand and pretend you know the difference between heirloom and regular tomatoes
					- Take a sunset walk on the beach while avoiding eye contact with other people
					- Order the most expensive cocktail on the menu and then complain about the price</p>

					<h2>üí∏ What Will Make You Say "Only in the Hamptons"</h2>
					<p>This weekend's "Only in the Hamptons" moment: witnessing someone pay $28 for a smoothie they could make at home for $3. "I watched this woman order a 'Detox Green Goddess Smoothie' for $28," said local barista Sarah Kim. "I asked if she wanted me to throw in a free kale leaf, and she said 'Oh, I don't eat kale. It's too mainstream.'"</p>

					<p>Other "Only in the Hamptons" moments to watch for:
					- Someone paying $150 for a beach umbrella that costs $25 at Target
					- A restaurant charging $45 for a bowl of air with a side of pretension
					- A local complaining about the "tourist problem" while wearing a "I Heart NY" t-shirt
					- Someone asking if the beach is "public or private" while standing at a public beach access point</p>

					<h2>üèñÔ∏è Weekend Weather Report</h2>
					<p>This weekend's forecast: Sunny with a chance of pretentiousness, scattered Range Rovers, and a 90% probability of someone mentioning how much better the Hamptons was "before all the people came."</p>

					<p>"The weather is perfect for Instagram photos," said local meteorologist Dr. Amanda Rodriguez. "But remember, if you're not posting about the weather, did it even happen?"</p>

					<h2>üöó Traffic Update</h2>
					<p>Traffic this weekend: Still terrible, but now with more Teslas and Range Rovers. "We're seeing a new phenomenon where luxury cars create their own traffic lanes," said traffic analyst David Chen. "It's like they're saying 'I paid $150,000 for this car, so I'm going to drive wherever I want.'"</p>

					<h2>üçΩÔ∏è Dining Recommendations</h2>
					<p>This weekend's dining tip: If you have to ask the price, you can't afford it. "That's our unofficial motto," said restaurant owner Pierre Dubois. "We like to keep our customers guessing. It adds to the excitement."</p>

					<p>Recommended restaurants:
					- **Le Petit Ch√¢teau**: Where a $12 burger costs $85 (but it's worth it because of the ambiance)
					- **Ocean View Bistro**: Where you pay extra for the privilege of seeing the ocean
					- **Local's Corner**: Where locals pretend to eat while actually just people-watching</p>

					<h2>üé≠ Social Etiquette</h2>
					<p>Remember: In the Hamptons, you're not just paying for food, drinks, or experiences - you're paying for the privilege of saying you did these things in the Hamptons. "It's about the story you can tell your friends back in the city," explained social consultant Jennifer Park. "The more expensive something is, the better the story."</p>

					<h2>What's Next?</h2>
					<p>As always, the key to a successful Hamptons weekend is to embrace the absurdity. "Don't fight it," said longtime resident Mike Thompson. "Just go with the flow, spend more money than you planned, and remember that everyone else is doing the same thing."</p>
